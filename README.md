In multilingual regions, access to education is often hindered by the lack of speech technology that supports local languages. 
Many existing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems struggle to identify and process multiple languages accurately. This project aims to develop a CNN-based model that classifies spoken audio clips into different languages, enabling better speech-to-text models, personalized learning tools, and improved accessibility for students who speak underrepresented languages.
